The @FETCH tag adds the SQL FETCH clauses for limiting the number of results returned.
This can differ by database, so the actual SQL is generated by the
configuration class.
The tag bases its actions on the specified literals or
integer variables beginning with a colon.

```sql
@NAME(SearchVariableRowCount)
    SELECT * FROM foo
    WHERE name = 'bar'
    ORDER BY date
    @FETCH(:num_rows)
```
