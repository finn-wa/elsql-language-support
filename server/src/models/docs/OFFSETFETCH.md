The offset-fetch tag adds the SQL OFFSET and FETCH clauses for paging results.
These can differ by database, so the actual SQL is generated by the configuration class.
The tag bases its actions on the specified literals or integer variables beginning with a colon.
The names "paging_offset" and "paging_fetch" are used if the variables are not specified.

In most cases, it is best to use the @PAGING tag as it allows window functions
to be used where necessary.

```sql
@NAME(Search)
    SELECT * FROM foo
    WHERE name = 'bar'
    ORDER BY date
    @OFFSETFETCH(:rowOffset,:pageSize)
```
