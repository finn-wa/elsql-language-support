The paging tag adds the SQL code to page the results of a search.
These can differ by database, so the actual SQL is generated by the configuration class.
The tag bases its actions on the specified integer literals or variables which begin with a colon.
This replaces the OFFSETFETCH/FETCH tags in most situations as it enables window functions to be used where necessary.

```sql
@NAME(Search)
	@PAGING(:rowOffset, :pageSize)
		SELECT * FROM foo
		WHERE name = 'bar'
		ORDER BY date
```
