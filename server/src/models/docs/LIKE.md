The like tag adds either an SQL = or an SQL LIKE based on the specified
variable.
If the tag has no variable in brackets, then the text between the LIKE
tag and the end of the line is parsed for a variable.
This tag can differ by database, so the actual SQL is generated by the configuration class.

```sql
@NAME(Search)
    SELECT * FROM foo
    WHERE name @LIKE(:name)
    AND UPPER(type) @LIKE UPPER(:type)
```
