# ElSQL Language Support

Based on the lsp-sample for VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide

## Structure

```
.
├── client // Language Client
│   ├── src
│   │   └── extension.ts // Language Client entry point
├── package.json // The extension manifest.
└── server // Language Server
    └── src
        └── server.ts // Language Server entry point
```

- Open VS Code on this folder.
- Press Ctrl+Shift+B to compile the client and server.
- Switch to the Debug viewlet.
- Select `Launch Client` from the drop down.
